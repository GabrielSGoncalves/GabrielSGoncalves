### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gabriel S. GonÃ§alves (S. from Santos, from my portuguese side), a Data Engineer from Brazil.

- ðŸ”­ I started my career in the academia working with bioinformatics, moving to the Data field where I worked with financial services and Machine Learning applied to sales.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My father is a civil engineer and he wanted me to follow his career footsteps, but I decided to become a scientist. After becoming a Data Engineer, I thought he would be happy about me somehow following his engineering path, but he still doesn't understand what exactly I'm "building with data" in my current position ðŸ˜„.
