### Hi there 👋
I'm Gabriel S. Gonçalves (S. from Santos, from my portuguese side), a Data Engineer from Brazil.

- 🔭 I started my career in the academia working with bioinformatics, moving to the Data field where I worked with financial services and Machine Learning applied to sales.
- 🏛️ I'm crazy about Data Architecture and solutions that enable companies extract the most out of Data.
- 🐘 I believe storing data without a proper use is a waste of money for companies.
- 🦉 You need to have a clear goal for your data strategy in order to transform it into information and finally decisions.
- 💬 And I'm the right guy to help you with that!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My father is a civil engineer and he wanted me to follow his career footsteps, but I decided to become a scientist. After becoming a Data Engineer, I thought he would be happy about me somehow following his engineering path, but he still doesn't understand what exactly I'm "building with data" in my current position 😄.
